    "# Topic Modeling With Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "*View this code on [Github](https://github.com/gkamradt/langchain-tutorials/blob/main/data_generation/Topic%20Modeling%20With%20Language%20Models.ipynb)*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic Modeling is the practice of pulling out categorized groups of information from a piece of longer text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Inferring chapters from a book or segments of a movie. This is a classic data science topic that has been studied for years. Check out examples from previous research like [scikit-learn](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-topic-modeling-using-scikit-learn-4c3f3290f5b9) and [BERTopic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZxQz87lb84) if you want to see these techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "However today we are going to take a pass at this problem using language models. Why? Language models are extremely good at processing text and pulling out big picture ideas from a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many methods to do this and my goal for today's tutorial is to show you a few different approaches so you can apply it to your own scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we are prioritizing comprehensiveness and robustness of information over API costs so please be mindful of your expense comfortability.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll be taking a 2-pass approach today:\n",
    "* **1st Pass:** Run through the entire document via map reduce and pull out topics as bullet points\n",
    "* **2nd Pass:** Iterate through your topic bullet points and expand on them with a subset of context that was selected via retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we are going to be looking at a [My First Million](https://www.mfmpod.com/) podcast because it's rich with segments, ideas, sayings, and stories. Great for topic parsing!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus**: As a bonus we are also going to be looking at how to auto generate timestamps for each topic as well. The most common use case of this is YouTube Chapters\n",
    "\n",
    "**My Assumptions**\n",
    "* You don't have a table of contents. That would definitely help out (since a human likely generated them) but I want to make this method as general as possible so you can apply it\n",
    "* You want to *learn* the nuts and bolts how to do this. If you wanted a 3rd party tool to do this for you I suggest something like [AssemblyAI](https://www.assemblyai.com/) or [PodcastNotes](https://podcastnotes.org/) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **YouTube Videos** - Auto Chapter Generation\n",
    "* **Podcasts** - Extract structured information\n",
    "* **Meeting Notes** - Send topic summaries to participants\n",
    "* **Town Hall Meetings** - Structured information\n",
    "* **Earnings Report Calls** - Sell structured data to investment groups\n",
    "* **Legal Documents** - Quickly summarize by topic\n",
    "* **Movie Scripts** - Quick bullet points for production recaps\n",
    "* **Books** - Auto generate table of contents\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if you want to see the inspiration for this tutorial, [here's the tweet](https://twitter.com/GregKamradt/status/1651957952725807106) that started it all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!"
